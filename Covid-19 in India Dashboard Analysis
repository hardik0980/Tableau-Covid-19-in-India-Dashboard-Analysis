Visualizing a pandemic
On January 20, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) confirmed that an individual in Washington State had contracted a case of COVID-19â€”a disease that was first observed in Wuhan, China in December. By the end of the month, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 was a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. By March 11, the CDC announced that COVID-19 was a pandemic.


A pandemic defined by data
Tableau was one of the first to recognize that data was going to play a central role in helping people see and understand what was happening. Our team went to work right away and developed what was to be the first of a number of tracker dashboards to help visualize the scope of the pandemic. We launched the COVID-19 Data Hub in March 2020 as a free resource for people and organizations to access the tracker dashboard. The Global COVID-19 tracker provided key metrics on where the pandemic was spreading, and impacts, including metrics on mortality and hospitalizations. Within days of launch, the Hub had garnered thousands of visits. Over the course of the next year, millions of visitors to the site accessed the site, seeing critical metrics in near-real time, using the Global Tracker dashboard. The Tracker enabled everyone from business and public sector leaders, to the general public, to get the information necessary to make informed decisions. Visitors could also access and download datasets to perform their own analyses.
